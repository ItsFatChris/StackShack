# StackShack
Stacking Game made in Unity

This is a physics based stacking game made for my Game Programming Class.
This version was made using Unity 2017.4.0f1 and the prject file may not open properly in newer versions of Unity. 

If there are issues when importing the project and the issues all involve TextMesh Pro then you can fix the issue by doing the following:
*There may be issues after doing this, and only has been tested to build and start the game*
Close the project.
Nevigate to the Assets folder in the project.
Delete the old TextMesh Pro folder.
Then open the project in Unity.
Go to Window-TextMeshPro-Import TMP essentials
Then Widnow-TextMesh Pro-Project Files GUID Remapping Tool
Scan 
Then save.

If you would like to try out the game I have put up a release of it built in Unity 2017.4.0f1 for you to try.
